# Complex Number Operations
Let's understand how complex numbers are manipulated in this project!
## Overview

The **Complex Number Operations** project is a C++ application designed to demonstrate and practice various operations with complex numbers. This project includes functionality for input, output, and manipulation of complex numbers, including handling dynamic and static arrays, performing arithmetic operations, and utilizing constructors and destructors.

## Files

- **ComplexNumber.h**: Header file defining the `ComplexNumber` class with its methods and member variables.
- **ComplexNumber.cpp**: Implementation file containing the definitions of the `ComplexNumber` class methods.
- **Driver.cpp**: Main file demonstrating the use of the `ComplexNumber` class through various operations and examples.

## Features

- **Complex Number Initialization**: Create and initialize complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
- **Dynamic and Static Arrays**: Manage complex numbers using both dynamic and static arrays.
- **Magnitude Calculation**: Compute the magnitude of complex numbers.
- **Copy Constructor and Assignment Operator**: Implement and utilize the copy constructor and assignment operator.
- **Destructor**: Handle memory cleanup for dynamically allocated complex numbers.

## Compilation

1. **To compile the project, use the following command:**
    ```bash
    g++ -o complex_number_operations Driver.cpp ComplexNumber.cpp
2. **Then run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./complex_number_operations

## Conclusion

These examples demonstrate how to work with the ComplexNumber class, showcasing its capabilities for creating, displaying, managing, and manipulating complex numbers. Feel free to modify and extend these examples to suit your needs.

Happy coding!
